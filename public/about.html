    <h1>About Burly Man Wines</h1>
    <p>
      Burly Man Wines is the brainchild of a group of close friends who, while chewing the fat around the fire at the end of their fishing and hunting adventures, realized there was a need for a line of wines befitting the rugged individuals that smoke our meats, keep our vehicles running, prevent our roofs from leaking, and do the dirty work to make our lives easier.

      It started, as many good ideas do, over a glass (or three) of wine. What began as a joke during a wine-tasting adventure a few years back — a group of friends wondering why wine couldn’t be just a little more, well... burly — became a recurring topic of laughter and imagination on every trip that followed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fast forward to the latest tasting weekend, and we finally admitted what we already knew: this wasn’t just banter anymore. It was time to make Burly Man Wines real — a creative brand built on camaraderie, humor, and the belief that good wine doesn’t have to take itself so seriously.
