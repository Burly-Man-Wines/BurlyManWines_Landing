## [Unreleased]

### 🚧 Planned / In Progress

- Modularize footer + header partials into template includes for future pages (done → verify pattern)

- Add “Founders” photo caricatures and bio tiles
- Add favicon set & metadata for SEO/social share

---

## [1.0.2] — 2025-11-06

### 🧰 Tooling / Automation

Added a **local-only deployment history tracker** for developer reference.

Introduced `update-deploy-history.sh`, which incrementally appends commit details to a Markdown ledger (`deploy-history.md`) for offline visibility into project activity.

#### Highlights

- Tracks only new commits since the last run (no duplication)
- Records commit count, timestamp, branch, and generator host/user
- Maintains last logged commit hash in `.deploy-last-hash` for incremental updates
- All three files are ignored via `.gitignore` to avoid CI/CD loops and remote noise

#### Usage

Run manually from the repo root:

    ./update-deploy-history.sh

#### Example Ledger Entry
